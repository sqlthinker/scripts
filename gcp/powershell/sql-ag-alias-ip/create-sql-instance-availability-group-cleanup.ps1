#.SYNOPSIS
# Do some cleanup after done testing with the script: 
#   create-sql-instance-availability-group.ps1
#
#.DESCRIPTION
# The script create-sql-instance-availability-group.ps1 creates a two node
# availability group. After you are done testing with the script you may want
# to remove the nodes, networks and firewall rules. This script provides some
# sample commands. You may need to modify some parameters to match your
# configuration.
